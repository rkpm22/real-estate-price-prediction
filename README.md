**Overview**
This project delivers an integrated platform for real estate property management and property price prediction. It simplifies the challenges of efficient property searching, broker management, and market analysis using advanced data science techniques.

Key Features:
Property Search: Search properties based on criteria like city, price, type, and number of bedrooms (BHK).
Broker Management: Efficient retrieval and management of broker information.
Market Trend Analysis: Analyze trends like average property sizes, price distributions, and property types.
Interactive Data Visualization: Graphical insights into real estate trends for better understanding and decision-making.
Predictive Modeling: Regression-based machine learning models for accurate property price prediction.

System Architecture
Technologies Used:
Database: MySQL for managing and normalizing property and broker data.
Backend: Python for data preprocessing, visualization, and ML model development.
Data Source: Kaggle dataset containing detailed property information.
Database Design:
Normalized schema with primary and foreign keys for integrity.
Scalability to include additional features such as property reviews and user roles.
Machine Learning:
Data preprocessing includes handling missing values, outlier detection, and dimensionality reduction.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for understanding data distribution and trends.
Predictive modeling using regression for price prediction.

Application Features
Broker Dashboard:
View and manage broker details.
Search and filter properties assigned to a broker.
Property Listing:
List properties based on user-defined criteria.
Add, update, or delete properties with ease.
Data Insights:
Visualize property trends, market dynamics, and city-wise data distributions.
AI-powered recommendations (planned in future iterations).
